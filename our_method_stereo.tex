\section{view selection for stereo}

In this section, we describe our algorithm of pixel-level view selection for stereo. 
The algorithm contains two steps. For a given pixel, we use the 
These two steps are interleaved until a stable station is achieved.

Based on the observation that the nearby pixels in the reference image has high likelihood of being seen by the same sets of target images, we
